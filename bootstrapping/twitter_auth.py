Basic Authentication
====================

Handles authorization with twitter API

Requirements:
    - libraries requests, requests_oauthlib, yaml and os (for finding and reading the auth keys)
    - twitter application credentials from apps.twitter.com -> Keys and Access Tokens -> Your Access Tokens

Talking to twitter
==================

Twitter uses version 1 of the widely used oauth procedure for getting access to its api. The process consists of multiple steps and generates a set of *tokens* that can be used similar to passwords. Each set of tokens is associated with one user or application. Requests issued with these are subject to the user account's limits (especially rate limits). This means it doesn't matter what computer the request comes from - all devices and IPs using the same tokens share the same allowance of requests.

The easiest way to obtain access is called `Application-only authentication`_: After creating a new application on twitter's developer pages, it is possible to create tokens for the application. You can generate your own on the tab *Keys and Access Tokens* under *Your Access Tokens*.
